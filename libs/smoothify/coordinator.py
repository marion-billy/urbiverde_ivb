    """Smooth geometries derived from raster data using Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm.

    Main entry point for smoothing jagged polygons and lines resulting from
    raster-to-vector conversion. Transforms pixelated edges into smooth, natural-looking
    curves while preserving general shape and area characteristics.

    Supports multiple input types:
    - Single geometries (Polygon, LineString, LinearRing, MultiPolygon, MultiLineString)
    - Lists of geometries or GeometryCollections
    - GeoDataFrames

    Invalid geometries (e.g. self-intersecting polygons) are not smoothed:
    each one is returned unchanged with a warning, regardless of how it is
    passed in. Repair them first with shapely's ``make_valid()`` (or
    ``GeoSeries.make_valid()`` for a GeoDataFrame) if you want them smoothed.

    Args:
        geom: Geometry, list of geometries, or GeoDataFrame to smooth.
        segment_length: Resolution of the original raster data in map units. Used for
            adding intermediate vertices and simplification. Should match or exceed
            the original raster pixel size. If None (default), automatically detects
            segment length by finding the minimum segment length, which represents the
            true pixel size in pixelated geometries (corners retain minimum length even
            when straight edges are simplified during polygonization).
        num_cores: Number of CPU cores for parallel processing (0 = all available cores,
            1 = serial processing). Only applies to GeoDataFrames and collections.
        smooth_iterations: Number of Chaikin corner-cutting iterations (typically 3-5).
            Higher values produce smoother results but add more vertices.
        merge_collection: Whether to merge/dissolve adjacent geometries in collections
            before smoothing. Useful for joining polygons from adjacent raster cells.
        merge_field: Name of column to use for dissolving geometries in GeoDataFrames.
            Only applies when merge_collection=True.
        merge_multipolygons: Whether to merge adjacent polygons within MultiPolygons
            before smoothing.
        preserve_area: Whether to restore original area after smoothing via buffering.
            Applied to Polygons only.
        area_tolerance: Percentage of original area allowed as error
            (e.g., 0.01 = 0.01% error). Default is 0.01% (99.99% area preservation).
            Smaller values = more accurate area preservation but slower.
            Only affects Polygons when preserve_area=True.

    Returns:
        Smoothed geometry matching the input type:
        - BaseGeometry for single geometry inputs
        - list[BaseGeometry] for list inputs
        - GeoDataFrame for GeoDataFrame inputs

    Raises:
        ValueError: If input is not a supported geometry type.

    Warns:
        UserWarning: If an invalid geometry is encountered; it is returned
            unchanged rather than smoothed.

    Examples:
        >>> from smoothify import smoothify
        >>> import geopandas as gpd
        >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
        >>>

        >>> polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10)])
        >>> smoothed = smoothify(polygon, segment_length=1.0, smooth_iterations=3)
        >>>
        >>> # Smooth with stricter area preservation (0.001% error)
        >>> smoothed = smoothify(polygon, segment_length=1.0, area_tolerance=0.001)
        >>>
        >>> # Smooth a GeoDataFrame in parallel
        >>> gdf = gpd.read_file("water_bodies.gpkg")
        >>> smoothed_gdf = smoothify(gdf, segment_length=10.0, num_cores=4)

        >>> gdf.geometry = gdf.geometry.make_valid()
